// This API route is no longer used as the contact form submission
// is handled client-side for static export compatibility.
// You can safely delete this file from your project.

// To re-enable server-side email sending, you would either:
// 1. Use Server Actions (if not strictly avoiding them).
// 2. Deploy to a Node.js compatible environment (not static export) and keep this API route.
// 3. Submit client-side to a third-party email service or serverless function.
